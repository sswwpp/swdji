        <h2>Streamlining User Experience for Retail Workers and Managers</h2>
        <p>
          In this case study, I will show you how our team transformed
          fragmented retail applications into a unified, modern solution.
          Drawing from user research, iterative design, and real stakeholder
          feedback, this project addresses usability challenges and delivers a
          streamlined interface for everyday retail operations.

        <h3>Here's Our Problem</h3>
        <p>
          Retail and corporate applications are often hindered by outdated,
          fragmented interfaces that compromise both efficiency and usability.
          Retail workers and managers face steep learning curves, frequent
          glitches, and a disjointed user experience. This project aimed to
          reimagine these tools by focusing on the actual needs of the end
          users, streamlining navigation, and combining essential functions into
          one intuitive interface.

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
          Our project primarily focused on refining the existing Chick-fil-A
          app, rather than creating a brand-new system. While we noticed similar
          issues across other retail companies, Chick-fil-A’s app was already
          fairly polished but scattered across multiple mini-apps. Employees and
          managers often had to navigate through several pages or apps to find a
          single feature. We wanted to consolidate these functionalities into a
          more cohesive, user-friendly interface.

        <h3>User Research & Findings</h3>
        <p>
          Through detailed interviews with a Chick-fil-A manager, a Starbucks
          shift supervisor, and other retail employees, several recurring issues
          emerged:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Employees and managers juggled multiple apps to access specific
            features or complete a single task.
          </li>
          <li>
            Steep learning curves due to fragmented, inconsistent interfaces.
          </li>
          <li>
            Outdated designs that felt clunky compared to modern smartphone
            applications.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These insights directly informed our design decisions, ensuring that
          each change addressed genuine user pain points.

        <h3>Design Process & Iterations</h3>
        <p>
          My role in this project involved synthesizing user feedback into
          actionable design improvements. Our process included:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Low-Fidelity Sketches:</strong> Early hand-drawn layouts
            that captured basic interactions and flow.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>UX Flow Diagrams:</strong> Mapping the user journey to
            ensure smooth navigation and pinpoint improvement areas.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Iterative Prototyping:</strong> Refining our Figma
            prototypes based on continuous stakeholder feedback to balance
            clarity, efficiency, and aesthetics.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Each iteration brought us closer to a streamlined solution that not
          only unified multiple functions but also felt intuitive for both new
          and experienced employees.

          Below are the final high-fidelity mockups showcasing the unified
          Chick-fil-A interface. We consolidated everything—facilities,
          inventory, employee management, and more—into a single, user-friendly
          platform:

        <p>Key features include:</p>

          <li>
            A navigation bar with contacts, bookmarks, notifications, and
            metrics, which are the most important features of the app.
          </li>
          <li>
            A bookmarking system for users who frequently use certain pages by
            just clicking on the bookmark icon on the top to save a specific
            page to the bookmarks tab.
          </li>
          <li>
            Intuitive navigation with customizable quick access widgets at the
            top of the home page.
          </li>
          <li>
            Streamlined task flows and navigation tailored for both frontline
            employees and managers to quickly find what they're searching for.

        <h3>Personal Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          This project has been a transformative learning experience. While
          collaborating with my team was invaluable, my personal contributions
          centered on interpreting user feedback and translating it into
          concrete design enhancements. The iterative process taught me the
          importance of stakeholder engagement and the delicate balance between
          functionality and a clean, modern aesthetic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moving forward, I plan to continue refining my design workflow and
          explore deeper ways to integrate user insights at every stage of
          development. The lessons learned here will undoubtedly shape my
          approach to future UX projects.
